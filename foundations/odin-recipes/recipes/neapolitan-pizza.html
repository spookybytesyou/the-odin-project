        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Neapolitan pizza is a type of pizza that originated in Naples,
            Italy, known for its thin, soft, and slightly wet crust with a
            puffy, leopard-spotted cornicione (outer edge). It's typically
            cooked in a wood-fired oven at extremely high temperatures for a
            short time. Authentic Neapolitan pizza features simple, fresh
            ingredients like San Marzano tomatoes, fresh mozzarella (buffalo or
            fior di latte), and basil.

            <li>600 ml water</li>
            <li>1 kg Flour Le 5 Stagioni Pizza Napoletana brand, 35 oz</li>
            <li>30 g Salt, 1 oz</li>

            <li>Pizza Toppings</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Combine flour, yeast, and water; mix and rest for 30 minutes.
                Add salt and knead for 15-20 minutes until smooth and elastic.
                Let it rise in the fridge for 24 hours or more, then bring to
                room temperature before shaping.
            </li>
            <li>
                Divide dough into balls, fold corners to center, and form smooth
                balls. Let them rise again at room temperature until doubled in
                size (about 2 hours).
            </li>
            <li>
                On a floured surface, press and gently stretch the dough into a
                12-inch circle, being careful not to tear it.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat pizza stone at highest oven temperature (about 550°F/290°C)
                for at least 45 minutes, then turn on broiler if available.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place dough on a floured peel, add a thin layer of tomato sauce,
                fresh mozzarella or bocconcini slices, fresh basil leaves, and a
                drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. Avoid overloading toppings to
                keep crust crisp.
            </li>
            <li>
                Slide pizza onto the hot stone, bake for 4-8 minutes until crust
                is lightly charred and cheese melted. Rotate if needed, keeping
                oven door closed as much as possible.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove pizza, cut into slices, garnish with fresh basil and
                olive oil if desired, and serve immediately.
