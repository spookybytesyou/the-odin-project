        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Chicken katsu curry is a popular Japanese dish featuring crispy,
            panko-breaded chicken cutlets served with a rich, savory curry sauce
            and steamed rice. The chicken is typically deep-fried until golden
            brown and crispy, providing a satisfying contrast to the smooth,
            flavorful curry. It's a comforting and delicious meal that combines
            the textures of crispy fried chicken with the aromatic and mildly
            spiced Japanese curry.

            too freaking lengthy.)
